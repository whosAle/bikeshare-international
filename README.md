# Bike share International

Bike share International helps users find and favorite bike share networks across the globe.

---
BSI allows users and owners to create, find, and rate neighborhood activities. Users can save networks and view them at any time if they create an account. Users simply find the city or area they are interested in searching, and are presented with all of the bikeshare networks available there. Then, a user can view the network's page, displaying an aggregate of information, statistics, and much more.

Run `bundle` and then `rails s` to start the server. In your browser go to `localhost:3000`.
